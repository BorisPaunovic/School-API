# School Management System API

 

Welcome to the School Management System API repository! This repository contains the source code and files for the RESTful API component of a school management system. The API is built using ASP.NET Core MVC and provides endpoints to manage various aspects of the school system, including students, teachers, courses and more.
Features

The School Management System API offers the following features:

    Students: Endpoints to manage student information, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting student records.
    Teachers: API endpoints for managing teacher details, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting teacher profiles.
    Courses: Endpoints to handle course management operations, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting courses.
    
    Authentication and Authorization: Secure endpoints using authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive data and operations.
    Validation and Error Handling: Built-in validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and provide meaningful error responses.
   
    Swagger Documentation: Integration with Swagger UI for interactive API documentation, allowing easy exploration of available endpoints and testing of requests.
